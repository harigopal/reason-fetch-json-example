# Reason Fetch & JSON Example

This project aims to demonstrate how to you fetch JSON data from APIs, and more importantly, encode and decode JSON with ReasonML.

To learn how, set up ReasonML using [official documentation](https://reasonml.github.io/), and then clone this repository and run:

```
# Install all dependencies.
$ yarn

# Run the application.
$ yarn run start

# This should launch the demo in a browser window.
```


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [reason-scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts).
